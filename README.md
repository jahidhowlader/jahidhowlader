Hello, This is Jahid. A passionate web developer. I have enough knowledge of frontend development and have basic knowledge of the backend like RESTful API.
I really enjoy learning new technologies. I have solved several web application problems with Reactjs, Expressjs, and MongoDB.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a keen eye for detail, problem-solving abilities, and a commitment to delivering high-quality code. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment, where I can contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals.
Thank you for giving me some valuable time.
